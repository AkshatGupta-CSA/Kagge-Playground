# Kaggle Playground Projects Repository

This repository is intended as a structured workspace for my participation in the **Kaggle Playground Series** competitions. It will serve as a collection of projects where I will practice and document various data science and machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, and tuning.

The content will be updated regularly as I explore new competitions and refine my approach to solving diverse machine learning problems.

## Repository Structure (Planned)

Each project will be organized in its own subdirectory.
